I. To get the database working you must do the following:

--How to?--
1. Install and Download 'xampp'. After downloading, make sure to start the Apache and MySQL in the xampp Control panel.
2. Go to your preferred browser and type this in the URL: "localhost/phpmyadmin/"
3. Create a database and name it dbtest and import the dbtest.sql file that you've downloaded
4. After that create a database again and name it dbimage and import the dbimage.sql that you've also downloaded earlier.
5. Done!


II. Don't go directly into index.php. Instead, go to login.php to login first (You can sign up for a new account if you don't have one)

--How to?--
*I'm assuming you're done installing all required softwares (xampp and VS Code).*
1. On your preferred browser type this in the url: "localhost/Electrical-Bulletin-Board-System/login.php". 
2. Login or sign up for a new one.
